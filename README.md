# Simon memory game

link: http://simon.educastrillon.xyz/ <br>
This repo was started on week 2 of a coding course. The intention is to practice new concepts by adding features to the game. In this project I have learned about dom manipulation and connecting it to the logic of the game itself.

## Dreamlist

 - Sound for accuracy
 - Flashing colors when winning
 - Database of highest scorers (looking into local storage)
 - Share on twitter button
 - ~~Difficulty levels including Godmode+~~<br>
   +Godmode includes increased speed and colours changing position
   
## Technologies used so far

  - HTML5
  - SCSS
  - JavaScript
  - jQuery

## To-Do

 - Implement rotation for Godmode
 - Tweak speeds to allow speed increments
 - Implement speed increments
 - Collect highest score in database
 - Create a scoreboard with users highest score
 - Add sounds to buttons for accuracy to real game
 - Randomise sounds to make Godmode even more confusing
