# Simon memory game

This is a minigame I have created to add features I want to practice. These features can range from animations to setting up a database or using an API.

## Dreamlist

 - Difficulty levels including Godmode+
 - Sound for accuracy
 - Flashing colors when winning
 - Database of highest scorers (looking into local storage)
 - Share on twitter button<br>
   +Godmode includes increased speed and colours changing position
   
## Technologies used so far

  - HTML5
  - SCSS
  - jQuery

## To-Do

 - Implement rotation for Godmode
 - Tweak speeds to allow speed increments
 - Implement speed increments
 - Collect highest score in database
 - Create a scoreboard with users highest score
 - Add sounds to buttons for accuracy to real game
 - Randomise sounds to make Godmode even more confusing
